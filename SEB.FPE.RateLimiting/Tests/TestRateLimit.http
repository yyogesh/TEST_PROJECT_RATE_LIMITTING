### Test Rate Limiting Middleware
### This file can be used with REST Client extension in VS Code
### Or use it as a reference for manual testing

@baseUrl = https://localhost:44301
@apiPath = /api/test

### Test 1: Make a normal request (should succeed)
GET {{baseUrl}}{{apiPath}}
Accept: application/json

### Test 2: Make multiple requests quickly to trigger rate limit
### Copy and paste this request multiple times (or use a loop)
GET {{baseUrl}}{{apiPath}}
Accept: application/json

### Test 3: Check rate limit headers
GET {{baseUrl}}{{apiPath}}
Accept: application/json

### Test 4: Test excluded path (should not be rate limited)
GET {{baseUrl}}/health
Accept: application/json

### Test 5: Test another excluded path
GET {{baseUrl}}/swagger
Accept: application/json
